title: Endpoint Types
---

Endpoints have a **type**, either `agent` or `cloud`. An Endpoint's `type`
determines its lifecycle, where its configuration is defined, and how it
handles connections.

**Agent Endpoints** (`agent`) are for creating connectivity to upstream
applications. They are created and configured by Secure Tunnel agent processes
and live for the lifetime of that agent process. They forward connections they
receive to the agent that started them.

**Cloud Endpoints** (`cloud`) are persistent endpoints whose creation, deletion
and configuration is managed centrally via the Dashboard or API. They use
Traffic Policy to handle traffic, usually routing to Agent Endpoints.

## Choosing the appropriate endpoint type

In general, Cloud endpoints are the most flexible option, but which endpoint type you should choose depends on your use-case. The following table outlines the differences between Cloud and Agent endpoints.

| **Property**   | **[Cloud Endpoints](/universal-gateway/cloud-endpoints/)** | **[Agent Endpoints](/universal-gateway/agent-endpoints/)** |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Lifecycle**  | Persistent. Must be manually terminated. | Live as long as the [agent](/agent) process that started them.  |
| **Connection Handling**  | Can be configured with a [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/).  |  Forward traffic to the agent that created them. |
| **[Configuration](/universal-gateway/endpoints/#configuring-endpoints)** | Managed via the [API](/api/) or dashboard. | Managed by the agent that initiates them. |
| **Dashboard accessibility** | Configurable from the dashboard. | Read-only in the dashboard. |
