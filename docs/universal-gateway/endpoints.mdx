title: Endpoints

An ngrok endpoint is a URL that enables network traffic to reach your services. You can use endpoints to allow traffic to:

- Integrate with third-party APIs.
- Communicate with devices.
- Access internal services.
- Deliver static responses.
- Access any other destination you require.

Endpoints are at the center of everything in ngrok; they're how you receive, route, transform, and forward traffic. They're also the primary way you put your apps and APIs online, whether those apps live on your local machine, private networks, or in the cloud.


## Use cases

You can use endpoints to control:

- **Where traffic originates from:** You can make a public, internal, or cloud endpoint by setting your endpoint's binding.
- **What protocol is used to handle traffic:** When specifying your endpoint's URL, you also specify its protocol, which can be HTTP/HTTPS, TCP, or TLS.
- **How requests are processed:** Transformations, business logic, load balancing, routing rules.
- **Where requests go:** A local server, cloud-based infrastructure, Kubernetes service, or any other destination.

Because endpoints are composable, you can configure them to handle diverse traffic flows, such as routing certain paths to different backends, applying security or authentication steps, or chaining multiple endpoints together (e.g., a public cloud endpoint forwarding traffic to an internal agent endpoint).

## Quickstart

Create your first endpoint with one of the following quickstart guides:

- **[Cloud Endpoints quickstart](/universal-gateway/agent-endpoints)** (Recommended) — Create a persistent, always-on endpoint hosted in the cloud that allows you to forward traffic to your internal resources.
- **[Agent Endpoints quickstart](/universal-gateway/cloud-endpoints)** — Create an endpoint that lives on your local machine and exists only for the lifetime of the [ngrok agent](/agent/) process that started it.

## Configuring endpoints

You can configure how your endpoints handle traffic by customizing their:
- **URL** — The address used to access your endpoint. For example: `https://app.example.com`.
- **[Protocol](/universal-gateway/protocols)** — The type of traffic your endpoint handles. For example: `http`, `https`, `tcp`, `tls`.
- **[Type](/universal-gateway/types)** — You can either have an [Agent endpoint]() or a [Cloud endpoint](). The type of endpoint you choose determines its lifecycle, where its configuration is defined, and how it handles connections. See [Choosing the appropriate endpoint type](/universal-gateway/types#choosing-the-appropriate-endpoint-type) for more information.
- **[Binding](/universal-gateway/bindings)** — 
- **[Traffic policy](/traffic-policy/)** — 


## Binding

Endpoints have a **binding** which is one: `public`, `internal` or
`kubernetes`. An Endpoint's binding determines where it is available to receive
traffic. Said another way, the binding defines where an endpoint 'listens'.

- **Public Endpoints** (`public`) - Endpoints with a `public` binding have a
  publicly addressable URL that receives traffic from the internet via the
  ngrok cloud service's global points of presence. e.g.
  `https://inconshreveable.ngrok.app`, `https://blog.inconshreveable.com`.

- **Internal Endpoints** (`internal`) - Endpoints with an `internal` binding
  can only receive traffic forwarded to them from other Endpoints in your ngrok
  account via the `forward-internal`. Internal endpoints have URLs that end in
  `.internal`. Example URLs: `https://example.internal`, `tcp://ssh.internal:22`

- **Kubernetes Endpoints** (`kubernetes`) - Endpoints with a `kubernetes`
  binding are private endpoints that are only available inside of Kubernetes
  clusters where you installed the ngrok [Kubernetes Operator](/k8s). Example
  URLs: `http://service.namespace`, `tcp://db.controlplane:5432`

## Traffic Policy

Every endpoint may specify a [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy) to handle the
traffic it receives with actions to route, transform, authenticate or reject
the traffic it receives.

TODO Example

## Pooling

[Endpoint Pooling](/universal-gateway/endpoint-pooling) allows you to create
multiple endpoints with the same URL. Traffic sent to a URL with an Endpoint
Pool is load balanced among the Endpoints in the pool.

You may set `allow_pooling: false` on an Endpoint to disallow Endpoint Pooling
on its URL.

## API

[Cloud Endpoints](/universal-gateway/cloud-endpoints/) are
programatically managed via:

- [`/endpoints` API Resource](/api/resources/endpoints/) of the [API](/api/)
- [`CloudEndpoint` CRD](/k8s/crds/) of the [Kubernetes Operator](/k8s/)

[Agent Endpoints](/universal-gateway/agent-endpoints), by contrast,
are programtically managed via:

- [Agent SDKs](/agent-sdks/)
- [Agent API](/agent/api/)
- [Kubernetes Operator](/k8s/getting-started-kic/)

Agent Endpoints are also included in a read-only capacity via:

- [`/endpoints` API Resource](/api/resources/endpoints/#list-endpoints) of the [API](/api)

## Pricing

Seat-based plans (Personal, Pro and Enterprise) include a fixed number of
endpoints that you may create based on the number of licenses you have
purchased.

On the Pay-as-you-go plan, there is no limit on the number of endpoints you
create. An endpoint that transmits data in a billing period is counted as an
active endpoint for billing purposes.

See [Pricing](https://ngrok.com/pricing)
for additional details on endpoint billing and pricing.
