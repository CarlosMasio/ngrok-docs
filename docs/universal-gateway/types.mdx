## Cloud Endpoints vs Agent Endpoints

In general, Cloud Endpoints are the most flexible option, but which endpoint type you should choose depends on your use-case. The following table outlines the differences between Cloud and Agent endpoints.

| **Property**                                                             | **[Cloud Endpoints](/universal-gateway/cloud-endpoints/)** | **[Agent Endpoints](/universal-gateway/agent-endpoints/)**     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lifecycle**                                                            | Persistent. Must be manually terminated.                   | Live as long as the [agent](/agent) process that started them. |
| **Connection Handling**                                                  | Can be configured with [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/). | Forward traffic to the agent that created them.                |
| **[Configuration](/universal-gateway/endpoints/#configuring-endpoints)** | Managed via the [API](/api/) or dashboard.                 | Managed by the agent that initiates them.                      |
| **Dashboard accessibility**                                              | Configurable from the dashboard.                           | Read-only in the dashboard.                                    |
| **Globally available**                                                   | Yes.                                                       | No.                                                            |
