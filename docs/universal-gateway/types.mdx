title: Endpoint Types
---

Endpoints have a **type**, which can be either `agent` or `cloud`. An Endpoint's `type` determines:

- How it's terminated
    - Could be in the dashboard, or by killing the agent process that created it
- Where its configuration is defined
- How it handles connections

## Agent Endpoints

Agent Endpoints are for creating connectivity to upstream applications. They are created and configured by [Secure Tunnel agent](/agent/) processes and live for the lifetime of that agent process. They forward connections they receive to the agent that started them.

## Cloud Endpoints

Cloud Endpoints are persistent endpoints whose creation, deletion, and configuration are managed centrally via the Dashboard or API. They use [Traffic Policies](/traffic-policy/) to handle traffic, usually routing to [Agent Endpoints](/universal-gateway/agent-endpoints) that you're running locally.

## Choosing the appropriate endpoint type

In general, Cloud Endpoints are the most flexible option, but which endpoint type you should choose depends on your use-case. The following table outlines the differences between Cloud and Agent endpoints.

| **Property**   | **[Cloud Endpoints](/universal-gateway/cloud-endpoints/)** | **[Agent Endpoints](/universal-gateway/agent-endpoints/)** |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Lifecycle**  | Persistent. Must be manually terminated. | Live as long as the [agent](/agent) process that started them.  |
| **Connection Handling**  | Can be configured with a [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/).  |  Forward traffic to the agent that created them. |
| **[Configuration](/universal-gateway/endpoints/#configuring-endpoints)** | Managed via the [API](/api/) or dashboard. | Managed by the agent that initiates them. |
| **Dashboard accessibility** | Configurable from the dashboard. | Read-only in the dashboard. |
