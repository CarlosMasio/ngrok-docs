title: Types
---

Endpoints have a **type**, either `agent` or `cloud`. An Endpoint's `type`
determines its lifecycle, where its configuration is defined, and how it
handles connections.

**Agent Endpoints** (`agent`) are for creating connectivity to upstream
applications. They are created and configured by Secure Tunnel agent processes
and live for the lifetime of that agent process. They forward connections they
receive to the agent that started them.

**Cloud Endpoints** (`cloud`) are persistent endpoints whose creation, deletion
and configuration is managed centrally via the Dashboard or API. They use
Traffic Policy to handle traffic, usually routing to Agent Endpoints.
