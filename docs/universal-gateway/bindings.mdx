title: Endpoint Bindings
---

Endpoints have a **binding** which is one: `public`, `internal` or
`kubernetes`. An Endpoint's binding determines where it is available to receive
traffic. Said another way, the binding defines where an endpoint 'listens'.

- **Public Endpoints** (`public`) - Endpoints with a `public` binding have a
  publicly addressable URL that receives traffic from the internet via the
  ngrok cloud service's global points of presence. e.g.
  `https://inconshreveable.ngrok.app`, `https://blog.inconshreveable.com`.

- **Internal Endpoints** (`internal`) - Endpoints with an `internal` binding
  can only receive traffic forwarded to them from other Endpoints in your ngrok
  account via the `forward-internal`. Internal endpoints have URLs that end in
  `.internal`. Example URLs: `https://example.internal`, `tcp://ssh.internal:22`

- **Kubernetes Endpoints** (`kubernetes`) - Endpoints with a `kubernetes`
  binding are private endpoints that are only available inside of Kubernetes
  clusters where you installed the ngrok [Kubernetes Operator](/k8s). Example
  URLs: `http://service.namespace`, `tcp://db.controlplane:5432`
