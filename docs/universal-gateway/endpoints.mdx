An ngrok endpoint is a URL that enables network traffic to reach your services. You can use endpoints to allow traffic to:

- Integrate with third-party APIs.
- Communicate with devices.
- Access internal services.
- Deliver static responses.
- Access any other destination you require.

Endpoints are at the center of everything in ngrok; they're how you receive, route, transform, and forward traffic. They're also the primary way you put your apps and APIs online, whether those apps live on your local machine, private networks, or in the cloud.


## Use cases

You can use endpoints to control:

- **Where traffic originates from:** You can make a public, internal, or cloud endpoint by setting your endpoint's binding.
- **What protocol is used to handle traffic:** When specifying your endpoint's URL, you also specify its protocol, which can be HTTP/HTTPS, TCP, or TLS.
- **How requests are processed:** Transformations, business logic, load balancing, routing rules.
- **Where requests go:** A local server, cloud-based infrastructure, Kubernetes service, or any other destination.

Because endpoints are composable, you can configure them to handle diverse traffic flows, such as routing certain paths to different backends, applying security or authentication steps, or chaining multiple endpoints together (e.g., a public cloud endpoint forwarding traffic to an internal agent endpoint).

## Quickstart

Assuming you have a working web application at port 8080, you can open your app to public traffic with the following [ngrok agent CLI](/agent/) command:

```bash
ngrok http http://localhost:8080
```

For a more detailed guide to creating your first endpoint, see one of the following quickstarts:

- **[Cloud Endpoints quickstart](/universal-gateway/agent-endpoints)** (Recommended) — Create a persistent, always-on endpoint hosted in the cloud that allows you to forward traffic to your internal resources.
- **[Agent Endpoints quickstart](/universal-gateway/cloud-endpoints)** — Create an endpoint that lives on your local machine and exists only for the lifetime of the [ngrok agent](/agent/) process that started it.

## Configuring endpoints

You can configure how your endpoints handle traffic by customizing their:
- **URL** — The address used to access your endpoint. For example: `https://app.example.com`.
- **[Protocol](/universal-gateway/protocols)** — The type of traffic your endpoint handles. For example: `http`, `https`, `tcp`, `tls`.
- **[Type](/universal-gateway/types)** — You can either have a [Cloud endpoint](/universal-gateway/cloud-endpoints/) or an [Agent endpoint](/universal-gateway/agent-endpoints/). See [the endpoint types documentation](/universal-gateway/types#choosing-the-appropriate-endpoint-type) to learn how to choose a type.
- **[Binding](/universal-gateway/bindings)** — Where the endpoint is available to traffic. For example, an `internal` endpoint is only accessible from other endpoints in your account. `public` endpoints are accessible from the internet.
- **[Traffic policy](/traffic-policy/)** — How your endpoint filters, matches, managees and orchestrates traffic.

## Load balancing with Endpoint Pooling

:::info Coming Soon
This feature is not yet generally available. [Contact us](mailto:support@ngrok.com) to
request access.
:::

[Endpoint Pooling](/universal-gateway/endpoint-pooling) allows you to create multiple endpoints with the same URL. Traffic sent to a URL with an Endpoint Pool is [load-balanced](/network-edge/gslb/) among the Endpoints in the pool.

See the [Endpoint Pooling quickstart](/universal-gateway/endpoint-pooling/#quickstart) to learn more.

## Managing endpoints with ngrok's APIs

[Cloud Endpoints](/universal-gateway/cloud-endpoints/) are
programatically managed via:

- [`/endpoints` API Resource](/api/resources/endpoints/) of the [API](/api/)
- [`CloudEndpoint` CRD](/k8s/crds/) of the [Kubernetes Operator](/k8s/)

[Agent Endpoints](/universal-gateway/agent-endpoints), by contrast,
are programtically managed via:

- [Agent SDKs](/agent-sdks/)
- [Agent API](/agent/api/)
- [Kubernetes Operator](/k8s/getting-started-kic/)

Agent Endpoints are also accessible in a read-only capacity via:

- [`/endpoints` API Resource](/api/resources/endpoints/#list-endpoints) of the [API](/api)

## Pricing

Paid plans (Personal, Pro and Enterprise) include a fixed number of
endpoints that you may create based on the number of licenses you have
purchased.

On the Pay-as-you-go plan, there is no limit on the number of endpoints you can create. An endpoint that transmits data in a billing period is counted as an active endpoint for billing purposes.

See [Pricing](https://ngrok.com/pricing) for more information.
